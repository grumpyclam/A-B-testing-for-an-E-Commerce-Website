Statistics. All statistics.



Holy smokes. This was the hardest project I've ever done. I had only ever done entry level statistics before this, what a challenge! **ab_data** and **countries** are the datasets I was working with. The project from begining to end is in **Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook**, there is an html and ipynb file for you to choose as you like. I prefer the ipynb file, it's easier to visualize.
